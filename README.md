# Terraria-Chat-Formatter
[> Downlead Page <](https://crawdad105.itch.io/terraria-chat) <br>
Colored text in chat is a thing that can be done, but its complicated, so this program can help you format text where you can just copy and past it into the terraria chat.<br>
I would recamend not using this program. It is slow, it was vary rushed, and only jsut works, it will also somtimes crash. <br>
Mabye this can be used as a template for another project, or mabye someone whats to fix the probloms and make it better, like include glifs and stuff.
